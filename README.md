# Stage-Simulation-in-Python
The project establishes a visual manifestation of a performance stage for the rock star band known as "Spinal Tap." We use Python and its libraries, such as NumPy and Matplotlib, to yield an interactive plot that demonstrates the stage arrangement, lighting effects, smoke machines, and the bandâ€™s props.
